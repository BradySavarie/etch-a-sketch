# Etch-a-Sketch

This Etch-a-Sketch app allows users to draw pictures with their mouse! The design was loosely modelled after the original 1980's Etch-a-Sketch toy. It supports grid sizes up to 64px (controlled by the grid size slider), and has 3 modes: color, rainbow, and eraser. You can choose your color using the color selector while color mode is active, and when you are done drawing your maserpiece you can clear the grid by simply clicking the shake button.
