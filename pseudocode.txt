the first thing I need to do is identify a method to create a 16x16 grid of square divs using DOM manipulation and flexbox

reduce the problem to it's simplest form
A single square div will fit inside a container that has locked square dimensions
if I change the dimensions of the div to half of the container and double the quantity, then multiply the quantity of existing divs by itself than I will have a 2x2 grid that fits perfectly within the container
if I change the dimensions of the div to a third of the continer and triple the quantity, then mulitply the quantity of existing divs by itself o will have a 3x3 grid that fits perfectly within the container
continue above thought for any number of containers
is there a way to have the dimensions automatically adjust rather than make an equation do it?
If I can have a single variable between 1-100 that is user generated, I can plug it in to a formula to determine the quantity multiplier/size divider

once i have that logic sorted it, i need to add hover functionality
eventlistener senses when a mouse hovers over any div within the container and changes the background color of that div to black.
queryselectall divs, create a nodelist with them, iterate through each object in the nodelist and attach the eventlistener to it. 
run a mousehover function as the callback
additional features can be added from there, but that is the main idea

Start with div that is the size of the container
Create new div
